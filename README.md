* Our app helps students stay organized by providing them with their schedule, depending on what courses they have registered.
* It also notifies them for new announcements, upcoming quizzes and assignments deliveries to help them keep track with their courses.
* The app will organize downloading and uploading materials.
* Thatâ€™s not it, the app will provide a forum for the students to communicate with each other.
* And many, many more.
