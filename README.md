This project aims to create a mobile application that will help students & staff at Faculty of Computers and Information, Cairo University.  
* Our app helps students stay organized by providing them with their schedule, depending on what courses they have registered.
* It also gives them a recap of new announcements, upcoming tasks, quizzes and assignments deliveries to help them keep track with their courses.
* The app will organize downloading and uploading materials.
* Thatâ€™s not it, the app will provide a forum for each course for the students to communicate with each other. And many, many more.
